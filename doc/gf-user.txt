INTRODUCTION					*gf-user-introduction*

*gf-user* is a Vim plugin to provide a framwork to extend |gf|.  Though |gf|
is one of the most useful commands in Vim, it has the following problems:

- The file to be opened is based on the word under the cursor.
- It's not possible to specify the cursor position for the opened file.

Sometimes you might wish |gf| used more text around the cursor to detect the
file to be opened and the initial cursor position.  For example,

- While reading output from diff(1), go to the hunk under the cursor.
- While editing files for an MVC framework, go to the view file corresponding
  to an action of the controller under the cursor. 

Though it's not hard to implement each extension, it's a bit troublesome to
synthesize all extensions.  |gf-user| provides a framework for the extensions.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.3 or later

INTERFACE					*gf-user-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS					*gf-user-functions*

gf#user#extend({funcname}, {priority})		*gf#user#extend()*
			Register an extension.  {funcname} is the name of
			a |gf-user-extension-function|.  {priority} is an
			integer which means the default priority for the
			extension.  See also |gf-user-extension-priority|.

gf#user#set_priority({funcname}, {priority})	*gf#user#set_priority()*
			Customize the priority for an extension.  {funcname}
			is the name of a |gf-user-extension-function|.
			{priority} is an integer which means the default
			priority for the extension.  See also
			|gf-user-extension-priority|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY MAPPINGS					*gf-user-key-mappings*

					   *g:gf_user_no_default_key_mappings*
						*:GfUserDefaultKeyMappings*
This plugin will define the following key mappings.  If you don't want to
define these default key mappings, define |g:gf_user_no_default_key_mappings|
before this plugin is loaded (e.g. in your |vimrc|).  You can also use
|:GfUserDefaultKeyMappings| to redefine these key mappings.  This command
doesn't override existing {lhs}s unless [!] is given.

==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZATION					*gf-user-customization*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXTENSION FUNCTION				*gf-user-extension-function*

An extension function:

- Takes 0 arguments.
- Returns 0 if any appropriate file is not found.
- Returns a destination information if an appropriate file is found.
- Should be named like "gf#{ext}#find", if it is an |autoload| function.

A destination information is a dictionary which has the following members:

"path" (string)
	A path of the file to be opened.

"line" (number)
	The line number for the initial cursor position.

"col" (number)
	The column number for the initial cursor position.
	If this value is 0, the cursor will be located to the first non-blank
	character (as |^| and |'| do).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXTENSION PRIORITY				*gf-user-extension-priority*

Basics:

- An extension has a priority which is an integer.
- A priority is to control the order of extension functions to be used.
- Registered extension functions are sorted by priority, then sorted by name.
- The built-in functions such as |gf| is used at the first.  Extensions are
  used if the built-in functions fail to find the file to be opened.

Conventions:

- Use 1000 if an extension uses only the text at the cursor line.
- Use 2000 if an extension uses text around the cursor.
- Use 3000 if an extension does not use text in the current buffer.
